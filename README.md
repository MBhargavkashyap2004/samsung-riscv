## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V is free and open, enabling anyone to design, implement, and customize processors without licensing fees or royalties. <br>

## Key Features of RISC-V:
* **Modularity**: RISC-V supports a base integer instruction set, with optional extensions like floating-point, vector processing, and more. <br>
* **Simplicity**: Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from microcontrollers to supercomputers.
* **Scalability**: RISC-V is versatile, supporting implementations for embedded systems, mobile devices, cloud computing, and beyond. <br>
* **Open and Extensible**: Developers can create custom extensions while remaining compatible with the standard ISA. <br>

RISC-V has rapidly gained popularity in academia, industry, and open-source communities, driving innovation in hardware design and accelerating the development of new computing solutions. <br>

This Github repository will be consisting of the tasks and projects which I will be doing throughout this Internship Program.

## Task 1

This task was regarding the setting up of UBUNTU environment for the RISCV project. <br>
In Task 1, a basic C program file was created and compiled using GCC compiler. Various outputs were observed by changing the variable values. <br>

The same file was compiled in riscv architecture, using riscv64 command, and the instruction sets were observed using 'O1' and 'Ofast' Optimizations. <br>

The instruction counts were observed. <br>
